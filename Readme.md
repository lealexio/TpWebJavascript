#Introduction

The objective was to create a javascript application allowing to draw geometrical shapes on a Canvas and to edit them.

#Design

An HTML file is associate with its CSS stylesheet, we used the latest online version of Boostrap to reduce the size of the project.

All the design has been made with Boostrap, the stylesheet is only used to display a scrollable menu with the drawn shapes and change the body color.

The release isn't responsive and work only on computers.

#MVC

The pattern MVC is used to edit and get interaction with user.
